I. Overview
=========
This suite supports evaluation of diarization system output relative
to a reference diarization subject to the following conditions:

- both the reference and system diarizations are saved within [Rich
  Transcription Time Marked  (RTTM)](#rttm) files
- for any pair of recordings, the sets of speakers are disjoint


II. Dependencies
==========
The following Python packages are required to run this software:

- Python >= 2.7.1* (https://www.python.org/)
- NumPy >= 1.6.1 (https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- SciPy >= 0.17.0 (https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

* Tested with Python 2.7.X, 3.6.X, and 3.7.X.


III. Metrics
======
Diarization error rate
---------------------------
Following tradition in this area, we report diarization error rate (DER), which
is the sum of

- speaker error  --  percentage of scored time for which the wrong speaker id
  is assigned within a speech region
- false alarm speech  --   percentage of scored time for which a nonspeech
  region is incorrectly marked as containing speech
- missed speech  --  percentage of scored time for which a speech region is
  incorrectly marked as not containing speech

As with word error rate, a score of zero indicates perfect performance and
higher scores (which may exceed 100) indicate poorer performance. For more
details, consult section 6.1 of the [NIST RT-09 evaluation plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20100606041157if_/http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/rt/2009/docs/rt09-meeting-eval-plan-v2.pdf).

Jaccard error rate
------------------
We also report Jaccard error rate (JER), a metric introduced for [DIHARD II](https://coml.lscp.ens.fr/dihard/index.html) that is based on the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). The Jaccard index is a similarity
measure typically used to evaluate the output of image segmentation systems and
is defined as the ratio between the intersection and union of two segmentations.
To compute Jaccard error rate, an optimal mapping between reference and system
speakers is determined and for each pair the Jaccard index of their
segmentations is computed. The Jaccard error rate is then 1 minus the average
of these scores.

More concretely, assume we have ``N`` reference speakers and ``M`` system
speakers. An optimal mapping between speakers is determined using the
Hungarian algorithm so that each reference speaker is paired with at most one
system speaker and each system speaker with at most one reference speaker. Then,
for each reference speaker ``ref`` the speaker-specific Jaccard error rate is
``(FA + MISS)/TOTAL``, where:
    
- ``TOTAL`` is the duration of the union of reference and system speaker
  segments; if the reference speaker was not paired with a system speaker, it is
  the duration of all reference speaker segments
- ``FA`` is the total system speaker time not attributed to the reference
  speaker; if the reference speaker was not paired with a system speaker, it is
  0
- ``MISS`` is the total reference speaker time not attributed to the system
  speaker; if the reference speaker was not paired with a system speaker, it is
  equal to ``TOTAL``
    
The Jaccard error rate then is the average of the speaker specific Jaccard error
rates.

JER and DER are highly correlated with JER typically being higher, especially in
recordings where one or more speakers is particularly dominant. Where it tends
to track DER is in outliers where the diarization is especially bad, resulting
in one or more unmapped system speakers whose speech is not then penalized. In
these cases, where DER can easily exceed 500%, JER will never exceed 100% and
may be far lower if the reference speakers are handled correctly. For this
reason, it may be useful to pair JER with another metric evaluating speech
detection and/or speaker overlap detection.

Clustering metrics
---------------------------------
A third approach to system evaluation is convert both the reference and system
outputs to frame-level labels, then evaluate using one of many well-known
approaches for evaluating clustering performance. Each recording is converted to
a sequence of 10 ms frames, each of which is assigned a single label
corresponding to one of the following cases:

- the frame contains no speech
- the frame contains speech from a single speaker (one label per speaker
  indentified)
- the frame contains overlapping speech (one label for each element in the
  powerset of speakers)

These frame-level labelings are then scored with the following metrics:

### Goodman-Kruskal tau
Goodman-Kruskal tau is an asymmetric association measure dating back to work
by Leo Goodman and William Kruskal in the 1950s (Goodman and Kruskal, 1954).
For a reference labeling ``ref`` and a system labeling ``sys``,
``GKT(ref, sys)`` corresponds to the fraction of variability in ``sys`` that
can be explained by ``ref``. Consequently, ``GKT(ref, sys)`` is 1 when ``ref``
is perfectly predictive of ``sys`` and 0 when it is not predictive at all.
Correspondingly, ``GKT(sys, ref)`` is 1 when ``sys`` is perfectly predictive
of ``ref`` and 0 when lacking any predictive power.

### B-cubed precision, recall, and F1
The B-cubed precision for a single frame assigned speaker ``S`` in the
reference diarization and ``C`` in the system diarization is the proportion of
frames assigned ``C`` that are also assigned ``S``. Similarly, the B-cubed
recall for a frame is the proportion of all frames assigned ``S`` that are
also assigned ``C``. The overall precision and recall, then, are just the mean
of the frame-level precision and recall measures and the overall F-1 their
harmonic mean. For additional details see Bagga and Baldwin (1998).

### Information theoretic measures
We report four information theoretic measures:

- ``H(ref|sys)``  --  conditional conditional entropy in bits of the reference
  labeling given the system labeling
- ``H(sys|ref)``  --  conditional conditional entropy in bits of the system
  labeling given the reference labeling
- ``MI``  --  mutual information in bits between the reference and system
  labelings
- ``NMI``  --  normalized mutual information between the reference and system
  labelings; that is, ``MI`` scaled to the interval [0, 1]. In this case, the
  normalization term used is ``sqrt(H(ref)*H(sys))``.

``H(ref|sys)`` is the number of bits needed to describe the reference
labeling given that the system labeling is known and ranges from 0 in
the case that the system labeling is perfectly predictive of the reference
labeling to ``H(ref)`` in the case that the system labeling is not at
all predictive of the reference labeling. Similarly, ``H(sys|ref)`` measure
the number of bits required to describe the system labeling given the
reference labeling and ranges from 0 to ``H(sys)``.

``MI`` is the number of bits shared by the reference and system labeling and
indicates the degree to which knowing either reduces uncertainty in the other.
It is related to conditional entropy and entropy as follows:
``MI(ref, sys) = H(ref) - H(ref|sys) = H(sys) - H(sys|ref)``. ``NMI`` is
derived from ``MI`` by normalizing it to the interval [0, 1]. Multiple
normalizations are possible depending on the upper-bound for ``MI`` that is
used, but we report ``NMI`` normalized by ``sqrt(H(ref)*H(sys))``.


IV. Scoring
======
To evaluate system output stored in [RTTM](#rttm) files ``sys1.rttm``,
``sys2.rttm``, ... against a corresponding reference diarization stored in RTTM
files ``ref1.rttm``, ``ref2.rttm``, ...:

    python score.py -r ref1.rttm ref2.rttm ... -s sys1.rttm sys2.rttm ...

 which will calculate and report the following metrics both overall and on
 a per-file basis:

- ``DER``  --  diarization error rate (in percent)
- ``JER`` --  Jaccard error rate (in percent)
- ``B3-Precision``  --  B-cubed precision
- ``B3-Recall``  --  B-cubed recall
- ``B3-F1``  --  B-cubed F1
- ``GKT(ref, sys)``  --  Goodman-Kruskal tau in the direction of the reference
  diarization to the system diarization
- ``GKT(sys, ref)``  --  Goodman-Kruskal tau in the direction of the system
  diarization to the reference diarization
- ``H(ref|sys)``  --  conditional entropy in bits of the reference diarization
  given the system diarization
- ``H(sys|ref)``  --  conditional entropy in bits of the system diarization
  given the reference diarization
- ``MI``  --  mutual information in bits
- ``NMI``  --  normalized mutual information

Alternately, we could have specified the reference and system RTTM files via
script files of paths (one per line) using the ``-R`` and ``-S`` flags:

    python score.py -R ref.scp -S sys.scp

By default the scoring regions for each file will be determined automatically
from the reference and speaker turns. However, it is possible to specify
explicit scoring regions using a NIST [un-partitioned evaluation map (UEM)](#uem) file and the ``-u`` flag. For instance, the following:

    python score.py -u all.uem -R ref.scp -S sys.scp

will load the files to be scored plus scoring regions from ``all.uem``, filter
out and warn about any speaker turns not present in those files, and trim the
remaining turns to the relevant scoring regions before computing the metrics
as before.

DER is scored using the NIST ``md-eval.pl`` tool with a default collar size of
0 ms and explicitly including regions that contain overlapping speech in the
reference diarization. If desired, this behavior can be altered using the
``--collar`` and ``--ignore_overlaps`` flags. For instance

    python score.py --collar 0.100 --ignore_overlaps -R ref.scp -S sys.scp

would compute DER using a 100 ms collar and with overlapped speech ignored.
All other metrics are computed off of frame-level labelings generated from the
reference and system speaker turns **WITHOUT** any use of collars. The default
frame step is 10 ms, which may be altered via the ``--step`` flag. For more
details, consult the docstrings within the ``scorelib.metrics`` module.

The overall and per-file results will be printed to STDOUT as a table; for
instance:

    File                           DER    JER    B3-Precision    B3-Recall    B3-F1    GKT(ref, sys)    GKT(sys, ref)    H(ref|sys)    H(sys|ref)    MI    NMI

Some basic control of the formatting of this table is possible via the
``--n_digits`` and ``--table_format`` flags. The former controls the number of
decimal places printed for floating point numbers, while the latter controls
the table format. For a list of valid table formats plus example outputs,
consult the [documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate) for the ``tabulate`` package.

For additional details consult the docstring of ``score.py``.


V. File formats
========
RTTM
-------
Rich Transcription Time Marked (RTTM) files are space-delimited text files
containing one turn per line, each line containing ten fields:

- ``Type``  --  segment type; should always by ``SPEAKER``
- ``File ID``  --  file name; basename of the recording minus extension (e.g.,
  ``rec1_a``)
- ``Channel ID``  --  channel (1-indexed) that turn is on; should always be
  ``1``
- ``Turn Onset``  --  onset of turn in seconds from beginning of recording
- ``Turn Duration``  -- duration of turn in seconds
- ``Orthography Field`` --  should always by ``<NA>``
- ``Speaker Type``  --  should always be ``<NA>``
- ``Speaker Name``  --  name of speaker of turn; should be unique within scope
  of each file
- ``Confidence Score``  --  system confidence (probability) that information
  is correct; should always be ``<NA>``
- ``Signal Lookahead Time``  --  should always be ``<NA>``

For instance:

    SPEAKER CMU_20020319-1400_d01_NONE 1 130.430000 2.350 <NA> <NA> juliet <NA> <NA>
    SPEAKER CMU_20020319-1400_d01_NONE 1 157.610000 3.060 <NA> <NA> tbc <NA> <NA>
    SPEAKER CMU_20020319-1400_d01_NONE 1 130.490000 0.450 <NA> <NA> chek <NA> <NA>

If you would like to confirm that a set of RTTM files are valid, use the
included ``validate_rttm.py`` script. For instance, if you have RTTMs
``fn1.rttm``, ``fn2.rttm``, ..., then

     python validate_rttm.py fn1.rttm fn2.rttm ...

will iterate over each line of each file and warn on any that do not match the
spec.

UEM
------
Un-partitioned evaluation map (UEM) files are used to specify the scoring
regions within each recording. For each scoring region, the UEM file contains
a line with the following four space-delimited fields

- ``File ID``  --  file name; basename of the recording minus extension (e.g.,
  ``rec1_a``)
- ``Channel ID``  --  channel (1-indexed) that scoring region is on; ignored by
  ``score.py``
- ``Onset``  --  onset of scoring region in seconds from beginning of recording
- ``Offset``  --  offset of scoring region in seconds from beginning of
  recording

For instance:

    CMU_20020319-1400_d01_NONE 1 125.000000 727.090000
    CMU_20020320-1500_d01_NONE 1 111.700000 615.330000
    ICSI_20010208-1430_d05_NONE 1 97.440000 697.290000
